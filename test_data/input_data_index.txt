All inputs are generated by the function "y = 10 * sin(x) + err."
All err's are derived from standard normal distribution.

input"n".txt includs 10^(n+1) individual data.
e.g. input1.txt includes 10 data

output"n"_"m".txt's are outputs corresponding to input"n".txt.
"m" indicates different types of highparameter "lamb".

Here is the index:
m = 1: lamb = 0.5
m = 2: lamb = 2.0
m = 3: lamb = 5.0
m = 4: lamb = 10.0
m = 5: lamb = 20.0
m = 6: lamb = 50.0
